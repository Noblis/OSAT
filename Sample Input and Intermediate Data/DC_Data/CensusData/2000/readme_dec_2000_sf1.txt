The geographic selections in the *geo.txt file may not have matching data values in the *data.txt files. This is because data from the PCT tables in Summary File 1 are not available for blocks or block groups. In addition, Quick Tables that contain data sourced from PCT series tables are not available for blocks or block groups.
